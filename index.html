                                     Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br/><br/>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                                     Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                                    At first, puppies spend the large majority of their time sleeping and the rest feeding. They instinctively pile together into a heap, and become distressed if separated from physical contact with their littermates, by even a short distance.[5]
